# Sounding Attention Labour with Critical Debugging - Workshop

The past years of technological development has seen a growing distrust in the tools that are used in everyday life. The commodification of human attention in data extractivism is going under more attentive scrutiny from governments around the world.
The general awareness of this technological failures has been brought forward, not only by academics but also artists and designers who challenge the technological given, by exerting their right to critique.
During the workshop the method of debugging will be subverted from technical error correction to a forensic tool to spot the site of data extraction. The latter will then be sonified and performed in the evening as an ensemble.
During the 6 hours workshop the group will have time to discuss the relationship between interface, labour and attention economy, engage with technical skills like network debugging with the firefox built-in tools, as well as the basics of modular sound design with VCV rack.

# Sounding Attention Labour - Performance

The past years of technological development has seen a growing distrust in the tools that are used in everyday life. The commodification of human attention in data extractivism is going under more attentive scrutiny from governments around the world.
The general awareness of this technological failures has been brought forward, not only by academics but also artists and designers who challenge the technological given, by exerting their right to critique.
Within this infrastructural framework the browser becomes the site of labour manufacture and extraction. Nevertheless, the extractive processes happen directly at users fingertips, and are therefore analyzable with debugging techniques, de facto subverting its use from error correction to forensic analysis. The performance will consist in the sonification of the latter and will be performed by the attendees of the workshop **_"Sounding Attention Labour with Critical Debugging"_**.

## BIO

**Yann Patrick Martins** is a debugger, artist and doctoral candidate of the Make/Sense Phd Programme, currently working at the IXDM as Research Assistant. Despite his practice rooted in programming, his doctoral research looks at the ways in which capitalist mode of production and machine learning are re-enacting forms of inequality and discrimination. He also has pioneered a teaching programme at the Critical Media Lab Basel that links technological education and cooking practices since 2018.
